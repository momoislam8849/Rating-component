# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component

![Design preview for the Interactive rating component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding.

I build an interactive rating component.

Users be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating


**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
